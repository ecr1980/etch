TOP etch a sketch project

This is a simple etch a sketch assignment for The Odin Project. It's base requirements are a 16 by 16 grid of static size, where mouse hovering will change the color. The project details suggest an upper limit of a 100 by 100 gird to prevent slow downs, freezes, or crashes for the user. There is an optional assignment to have the ability for mouse hovering to change the box to a random RGB value rather than simply black or white.

As this is supposed to be a portfolio piece, this should also have a much cleaner look than the previous projects which were focused more on functionality. Not to take away from the functionality of this project. I am simply adding a goal of a webpage that is also easy on the eyes. With that in mind, my intent is to replace the random RGB value option with an enthusiest PC RGB option, which will focus significantly more on teal and magenta, as well as other RGB values that will appear more attractive together, rather than putting every possible option together just because it can be done.
